As you look through the trusses of the bridge you can see the cityscape in the background. The bridge with its sturdy, but rusting metal stains, engages your eye as you study its construction. You can see that the wood panels that this paining is on run vertical through the painting, however the strength of the horizontal braces will guide your view across the width of the painting. The 48-inch high and 32-inch wide painting is done with tomes of grey and rust with a touch of blue in just the right places and will add a strong feature to your rustic style home or office decor.",
